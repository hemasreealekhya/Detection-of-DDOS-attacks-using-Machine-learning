# Detection-of-DDOS-attacks-using-Machine-learning
This project focuses on the development and implementation of proactive 
defence strategies for detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. 
Leveraging a combination of machine learning techniques including Random Forest, 
Neural Networks, and Logistic Regression, the aim is to enhance the ability to detect and 
mitigate DDoS attacks in real-time. The Random Forest algorithm offers robustness and 
scalability, allowing for effective feature selection and classification of network traffic 
patterns. Neural Networks provide the capability to recognize complex patterns and 
anomalies in network behaviour, enabling accurate identification of DDoS attack 
signatures. Logistic Regression offers interpretability and efficiency in modelling the 
probability of an event occurring. By integrating these machine learning algorithms into 
a comprehensive defence framework, this project seeks to enhance the resilience of 
network infrastructures against DDoS attacks. Real-time monitoring and analysis of 
network traffic data enable swift detection of anomalous activities indicative of DDoS 
attacks. Upon detection, appropriate mitigation strategies can be deployed to mitigate the 
impact and restore normal network operation.
